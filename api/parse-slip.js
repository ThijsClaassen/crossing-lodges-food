// Vercel serverless function — reads a photo of a purchase slip/invoice and
// returns the line items, quantities, and prices as structured JSON, using
// Anthropic's Claude API (vision-capable model). This runs server-side
// specifically so the Anthropic API key never reaches the browser — unlike
// the Supabase anon key (which is designed to be public), an Anthropic API
// key is a real secret and must never be embedded in client-side code.
//
// Requires an ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable, set in Vercel →
// Project Settings → Environment Variables (NOT in .env committed to the
// repo, and NOT in src/ anywhere). See the README for setup steps.
//
// This file lives in /api, which Vercel automatically treats as a
// serverless function regardless of the frontend framework — no extra
// config needed for it to be picked up on deploy. It does NOT run under
// `npm run dev` (Vite's dev server doesn't know about /api routes); use
// `vercel dev` locally if you want to test this specific feature before
// deploying, or just test after deploying, which is the normal flow for
// these apps anyway.

export const config = {
  maxDuration: 30, // seconds — vision calls can take a few seconds longer than a typical API request

const EXTRACTION_PROMPT = `You are reading a photo of a supplier purchase slip, delivery note, or invoice for a hospitality kitchen. Extract every line item you can read, plus the supplier name and date if visible.

Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no markdown code fences, no commentary before or after), exactly matching this shape:

{
  "supplier_guess": "string or null — the supplier/vendor name printed on the slip, if visible",
  "date_guess": "YYYY-MM-DD or null — the slip's date, if visible",
  "slip_total": number or null — the grand total printed on the slip, if visible (whatever VAT treatment it's printed in — don't adjust it),
  "amounts_include_vat_guess": true, false, or null — true if the line/total amounts on the slip appear to be VAT-inclusive (e.g. a "Total incl VAT" line, a retail-style till slip with no separate ex-VAT column), false if they clearly appear to be VAT-exclusive (e.g. a tax invoice showing "Subtotal (excl VAT)" separately from a VAT line and an incl-VAT grand total), or null if you genuinely can't tell,
  "vat_rate_guess": number or null — the VAT percentage if explicitly printed on the slip (e.g. 15 for "VAT 15%"), otherwise null,
  "zero_rated_marker": "string or null — the exact symbol or code this slip uses to mark zero-rated / VAT-exempt items, if you can determine it (see the VAT MARKERS section below)",
  "zero_rated_marker_source": "legend, convention, or null — 'legend' if you read the meaning off a printed key/legend on this slip, 'convention' if you inferred it from the retailer's usual practice without a printed legend, null if you found no marker at all",
  "line_items": [
    {
      "raw_text": "string — the item description exactly as printed, cleaned of stray OCR noise. Keep any VAT marker symbol in place here rather than stripping it, so a person can check your reading",
      "qty": number — quantity/units purchased, default to 1 if not shown separately,
      "unit_price": number or null — price per unit if shown, in whatever VAT treatment is printed,
      "total_price": number — the line total, in whatever VAT treatment is printed (don't convert it — that's handled separately). If only unit_price is shown, compute qty * unit_price. If only total_price is shown, leave unit_price null.
      "zero_rated": true, false, or null — see VAT MARKERS below. null means you could not tell for this line.
    }
  ]
}

VAT MARKERS (South African retail slips):
- Many retailers print a symbol next to each item showing its VAT status, and a legend somewhere on the slip explaining it — e.g. "# = zero rated", "* = VAT exempt", or letter codes with a key such as "A = standard rated, B = zero rated".
- ALWAYS look for that printed legend first and use what it actually says. Do NOT assume a particular symbol means zero-rated across all retailers — the same symbol means different things at different stores, and some slips use a symbol to mark the VAT-BEARING items rather than the exempt ones. Reading the slip's own key is the only reliable way.
- If a legend is printed, set zero_rated_marker_source to "legend" and mark each line accordingly.
- If no legend is printed but the retailer is identifiable and you are confident of its convention, you may apply it — but set zero_rated_marker_source to "convention" so the app can show a person that this was inferred rather than read.
- If there is no marker system on the slip at all, set zero_rated_marker and zero_rated_marker_source to null and set zero_rated to null on every line. Do NOT guess an item's VAT status from what the product is — the app has its own record of that and will use it. Your job is only to report what the slip physically shows.
- A line with no marker on a slip that clearly does use markers means that line is NOT zero-rated: report false, not null.

Rules:
- Only include real purchasable line items — skip subtotals, tax lines, discounts, and the grand total line itself (that goes in slip_total instead).
- If a quantity or price is genuinely illegible, make your best reasonable estimate rather than omitting the line, but keep raw_text faithful to what's printed.
- Numbers must be plain JSON numbers, not strings, and not include currency symbols.
- Report prices exactly as printed on the slip — do not attempt to add or remove VAT yourself, that's handled by the app afterward based on amounts_include_vat_guess, vat_rate_guess and each line's zero_rated flag.
- If the image isn't a purchase slip at all, or nothing is legible, return an empty line_items array.`
