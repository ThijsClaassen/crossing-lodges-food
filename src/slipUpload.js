// Purchase slip storage helper — 2026-08-12.
//
// Uploads a slip photo to the shared "purchase-slips" Supabase Storage
// bucket and creates its purchase_slips record (see add_purchase_slips.sql
// in the Ops app folder — that migration is shared across all 4 apps that
// have purchases, run once against the shared project; this app's
// food_purchases.slip_id column was already added by that same migration,
// this is just the first time Food's own UI actually uses it).
//
// Returns the new purchase_slips row, whose `id` is the slip_id to stash on
// whichever food_purchases row(s) this photo covers — several rows can
// share one slip_id when one delivery note has several line items.
